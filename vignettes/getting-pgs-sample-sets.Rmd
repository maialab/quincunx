## Sample sets

A sample set is a group of samples used in a polygenic score evaluation.Each
sample set is identified in the PGS Catalog by a unique sample set identifier
(`pss_id`). See `vignette('cohorts-samples-sample-sets')` for more details on
the relationship between cohorts, samples, and sample sets.

## Getting sample sets

To get information on sample sets you can either search by the associated
polygenic score identifiers, or by the sample set identifiers themselves (if you
know them beforehand).

### By the PGS identifier

```{r}
# Sample sets used in the evaluation of the PGS000013
(pgs_13_sset <- get_sample_sets(pgs_id = 'PGS000013'))
```

### By the sample set identifier

```{r}
# Sample set PSS000020
(pss_20 <- get_sample_sets(pss_id = 'PSS000020'))
```

### By trait or disease

If you wish to search by other criteria other than the PGS identifier or the PSS
identifier, then you will need to do it in several steps. The general approach
is to map your criteria to matching PGS identifiers and from those PGS IDs to
sample sets using `get_sample_sets()`.

Let's say that you want to retrieve all sample sets used in the evaluation of
polygenic scores for the disease Vitiligo (loss of skin melanocytes that causes
areas of skin depigmentation).

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Vitiligo of the hands in a person with dark skin. Source (CC BY-SA 3.0): https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo.'}
knitr::include_graphics('../man/figures/vitiligo.png') 
```

We start by searching for this disease in the PGS Catalog with `get_traits()`:

```{r}
(traits_vitiligo <- get_traits(trait_term = 'Vitiligo'))
```

The slot `pgs_ids` contains the polygenic score identifiers associated with
Vitiligo.

```{r}
traits_vitiligo@pgs_ids
```

Now to search for the sample sets, we can pass those PGS identifiers to
`get_sample_sets()`:

```{r}
(pss_vitiligo <- get_sample_sets(pgs_id = traits_vitiligo@pgs_ids$pgs_id))
```
