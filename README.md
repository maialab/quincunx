The goal of quincunx is to provide programmatic access to the [Polygenic
Score (PGS) Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/), an open resource for
[polygenic scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score) and
associated metadata describing their development and respective
assessment.

## Package name and hex sticker

The package name *quincunx* is another name for [Galton
Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine), that so nicely
exemplifies the [Central Limit
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), which in
turn is a key concept of genetics, namely, [Fisher’s infinitesimal
model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2017.09.003)… which leads us to
Polygenic Scores, the key concept of the PGS Catalog.

The bird in the hex sticker is a *Porphyrio porphyrio*, an emblematic
species native to the Ria Formosa Natural Park, which is a wildlife
reserve surrounding the University of Algarve, where the authors are
affiliated.
